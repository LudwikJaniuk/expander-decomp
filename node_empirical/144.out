The cut with highest capacity required was found on round20
Best cut sparsity: 
Edge crossings (E) : 6823
cut size: (61714 | 82936)
diff: 21222 (0.146713 of total n vertices)
Min side: 61714
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.110558
Writing partition with 144650 nodes to file out/144.ptn

The given partition achieved the following:
Edge crossings (E) : 6346
cut size: (68708 | 75942)
diff: 7234 (0.0500104 of total n vertices)
Min side: 68708
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.0923619
