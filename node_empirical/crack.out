The cut with highest capacity required was found on round11
Best cut sparsity: 
Edge crossings (E) : 203
cut size: (4278 | 5962)
diff: 1684 (0.164453 of total n vertices)
Min side: 4278
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.0474521
Writing partition with 10240 nodes to file out/crack.ptn

The given partition achieved the following:
Edge crossings (E) : 0
cut size: (0 | 10240)
diff: 10240 (1 of total n vertices)
Min side: 0
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = -nan
