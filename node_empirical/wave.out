The cut with highest capacity required was found on round16
Best cut sparsity: 
Edge crossings (E) : 4517
cut size: (37079 | 119239)
diff: 82160 (0.525595 of total n vertices)
Min side: 37079
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.121821
Writing partition with 156318 nodes to file out/wave.ptn

The given partition achieved the following:
Edge crossings (E) : 8524
cut size: (74253 | 82065)
diff: 7812 (0.0499751 of total n vertices)
Min side: 74253
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.114797
