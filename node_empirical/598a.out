The cut with highest capacity required was found on round24
Best cut sparsity: 
Edge crossings (E) : 2342
cut size: (53033 | 57939)
diff: 4906 (0.0442094 of total n vertices)
Min side: 53033
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.0441612
Writing partition with 110972 nodes to file out/598a.ptn

The given partition achieved the following:
Edge crossings (E) : 2337
cut size: (53117 | 57855)
diff: 4738 (0.0426955 of total n vertices)
Min side: 53117
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.0439972
