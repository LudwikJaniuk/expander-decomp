The cut with highest capacity required was found on round14
Best cut sparsity: 
Edge crossings (E) : 2571
cut size: (15167 | 62969)
diff: 47802 (0.611779 of total n vertices)
Min side: 15167
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.169513
Writing partition with 78136 nodes to file out/fe_tooth.ptn

The given partition achieved the following:
Edge crossings (E) : 3773
cut size: (37569 | 40567)
diff: 2998 (0.038369 of total n vertices)
Min side: 37569
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.100429
