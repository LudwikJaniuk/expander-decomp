The cut with highest capacity required was found on round15
Best cut sparsity: 
Edge crossings (E) : 647
cut size: (29571 | 33061)
diff: 3490 (0.0557223 of total n vertices)
Min side: 29571
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.0218795
Writing partition with 62632 nodes to file out/brack2.ptn

The given partition achieved the following:
Edge crossings (E) : 661
cut size: (30032 | 32600)
diff: 2568 (0.0410014 of total n vertices)
Min side: 30032
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.0220099
