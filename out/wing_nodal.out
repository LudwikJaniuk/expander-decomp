The cut with highest capacity required was found on round12
Best cut sparsity: 
Edge crossings (E) : 405
cut size: (1205 | 9733)
diff: 8528 (0.779667 of total n vertices)
Min side: 1205
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.3361
Writing partition with 10938 nodes to file out/wing_nodal.ptn

The given partition achieved the following:
Edge crossings (E) : 1669
cut size: (5195 | 5743)
diff: 548 (0.0501006 of total n vertices)
Min side: 5195
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.32127
