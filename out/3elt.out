The cut with highest capacity required was found on round1
Best cut sparsity: 
Edge crossings (E) : 62
cut size: (801 | 3919)
diff: 3118 (0.660593 of total n vertices)
Min side: 801
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.0774032
Writing partition with 4720 nodes to file out/3elt.ptn

The given partition achieved the following:
