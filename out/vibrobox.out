The cut with highest capacity required was found on round0
Best cut sparsity: 
Edge crossings (E) : 0
cut size: (0 | 12328)
diff: 12328 (1 of total n vertices)
Min side: 0
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = -nan
Writing partition with 12328 nodes to file out/vibrobox.ptn

The given partition achieved the following:
Edge crossings (E) : 10310
cut size: (6144 | 6184)
diff: 40 (0.00324465 of total n vertices)
Min side: 6144
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 1.67806
