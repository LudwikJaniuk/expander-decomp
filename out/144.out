CASE2 G Expansion target reached with a cut that is relatively balanced. Cut-matching game has found a balanced cut as good as you wanted it.
The best with highest expansion was found on round2
Best cut sparsity: 
Edge crossings (E) : 46504
cut size: (38710 | 105940)
diff: 67230 (0.464777 of total n vertices)
Min side: 38710
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 1.20134
CASE2 Goodenough balanced cut
Writing partition with 144650 nodes to file out/144.ptn

The given partition achieved the following:
Edge crossings (E) : 6346
cut size: (68708 | 75942)
diff: 7234 (0.0500104 of total n vertices)
Min side: 68708
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.0923619
