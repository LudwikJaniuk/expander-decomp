CASE2 G Expansion target reached with a cut that is relatively balanced. Cut-matching game has found a balanced cut as good as you wanted it.
The best with highest expansion was found on round0
Best cut sparsity: 
Edge crossings (E) : 1663
cut size: (167 | 448529)
diff: 448362 (0.999256 of total n vertices)
Min side: 167
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 9.95808
CASE2 Goodenough balanced cut
Writing partition with 448696 nodes to file out/auto.ptn

The given partition achieved the following:
Edge crossings (E) : 9451
cut size: (213164 | 235532)
diff: 22368 (0.0498511 of total n vertices)
Min side: 213164
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.0443368
