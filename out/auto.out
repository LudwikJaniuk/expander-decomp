The cut with highest capacity required was found on round17
Best cut sparsity: 
Edge crossings (E) : 6431
cut size: (123922 | 324774)
diff: 200852 (0.447635 of total n vertices)
Min side: 123922
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.0518955
Writing partition with 448696 nodes to file out/auto.ptn

The given partition achieved the following:
Edge crossings (E) : 9451
cut size: (213164 | 235532)
diff: 22368 (0.0498511 of total n vertices)
Min side: 213164
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.0443368
