The cut with highest capacity required was found on round15
Best cut sparsity: 
Edge crossings (E) : 1881
cut size: (46959 | 52659)
diff: 5700 (0.0572186 of total n vertices)
Min side: 46959
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.0400562
Writing partition with 99618 nodes to file out/fe_rotor.ptn

The given partition achieved the following:
Edge crossings (E) : 1940
cut size: (47334 | 52284)
diff: 4950 (0.0496898 of total n vertices)
Min side: 47334
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.0409853
