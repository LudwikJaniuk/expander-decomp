The cut with highest capacity required was found on round0
Best cut sparsity: 
Edge crossings (E) : 223
cut size: (6647 | 8959)
diff: 2312 (0.148148 of total n vertices)
Min side: 6647
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.033549
Writing partition with 15606 nodes to file out/4elt.ptn

The given partition achieved the following:
Edge crossings (E) : 0
cut size: (0 | 15606)
diff: 15606 (1 of total n vertices)
Min side: 0
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = -nan
