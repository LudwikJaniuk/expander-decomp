The cut with highest capacity required was found on round11
Best cut sparsity: 
Edge crossings (E) : 129
cut size: (5560 | 10046)
diff: 4486 (0.287454 of total n vertices)
Min side: 5560
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.0232014
Writing partition with 15606 nodes to file out/4elt.ptn

The given partition achieved the following:
Edge crossings (E) : 0
cut size: (0 | 15606)
diff: 15606 (1 of total n vertices)
Min side: 0
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = -nan
