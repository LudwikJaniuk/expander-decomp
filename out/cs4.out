The cut with highest capacity required was found on round22
Best cut sparsity: 
Edge crossings (E) : 315
cut size: (8202 | 14298)
diff: 6096 (0.270933 of total n vertices)
Min side: 8202
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.0384053
Writing partition with 22500 nodes to file out/cs4.ptn

The given partition achieved the following:
Edge crossings (E) : 353
cut size: (10689 | 11811)
diff: 1122 (0.0498667 of total n vertices)
Min side: 10689
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.0330246
