The cut with highest capacity required was found on round18
Best cut sparsity: 
Edge crossings (E) : 3807
cut size: (71296 | 143470)
diff: 72174 (0.336059 of total n vertices)
Min side: 71296
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.0533971
Writing partition with 214766 nodes to file out/m14b.ptn

The given partition achieved the following:
Edge crossings (E) : 3803
cut size: (102233 | 112533)
diff: 10300 (0.0479592 of total n vertices)
Min side: 102233
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.0371993
