The cut with highest capacity required was found on round13
Best cut sparsity: 
Edge crossings (E) : 554
cut size: (6002 | 38608)
diff: 32606 (0.730912 of total n vertices)
Min side: 6002
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.0923026
Writing partition with 44610 nodes to file out/bcsstk32.ptn

The given partition achieved the following:
Edge crossings (E) : 4622
cut size: (21290 | 23320)
diff: 2030 (0.0455055 of total n vertices)
Min side: 21290
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.217097
