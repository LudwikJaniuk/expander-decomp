The cut with highest capacity required was found on round1
Best cut sparsity: 
Edge crossings (E) : 1
cut size: (5 | 17753)
diff: 17748 (0.999437 of total n vertices)
Min side: 5
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.2
Writing partition with 17758 nodes to file out/memplus.ptn

The given partition achieved the following:
Edge crossings (E) : 5253
cut size: (8436 | 9322)
diff: 886 (0.049893 of total n vertices)
Min side: 8436
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.622688
