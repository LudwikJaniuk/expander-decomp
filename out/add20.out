H Expansion target reached, this will be case 1 or 3. According to theory, this means we probably won't find a better cut. That is, assuming you set H_phi right. If was used together with G_phi target, this also certifies the input graph is a G_phi expander unless there was a very unbaanced cut somewhere, which we will proceed to look for.
The best with highest expansion was found on round0
Best cut sparsity: 
Edge crossings (E) : 38
cut size: (11 | 2385)
diff: 2374 (0.990818 of total n vertices)
Min side: 11
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 3.45455
CASE3 Found goodenough but very unbalanced cut.
Writing partition with 2396 nodes to file out/add20.ptn

The given partition achieved the following:
Edge crossings (E) : 537
cut size: (1139 | 1257)
diff: 118 (0.0492487 of total n vertices)
Min side: 1139
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.471466
