The cut with highest capacity required was found on round0
Best cut sparsity: 
Edge crossings (E) : 2
cut size: (10 | 2386)
diff: 2376 (0.991653 of total n vertices)
Min side: 10
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.2
Writing partition with 2396 nodes to file out/add20.ptn

The given partition achieved the following:
Edge crossings (E) : 537
cut size: (1139 | 1257)
diff: 118 (0.0492487 of total n vertices)
Min side: 1139
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.471466
