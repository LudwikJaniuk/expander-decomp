The cut with highest capacity required was found on round0
Best cut sparsity: 
Edge crossings (E) : 0
cut size: (0 | 8738)
diff: 8738 (1 of total n vertices)
Min side: 0
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = -nan
Writing partition with 8738 nodes to file out/bcsstk33.ptn

The given partition achieved the following:
Edge crossings (E) : 9914
cut size: (4184 | 4554)
diff: 370 (0.0423438 of total n vertices)
Min side: 4184
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 2.3695
