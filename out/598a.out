The cut with highest capacity required was found on round0
Best cut sparsity: 
Edge crossings (E) : 0
cut size: (0 | 110972)
diff: 110972 (1 of total n vertices)
Min side: 0
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = -nan
Writing partition with 110972 nodes to file out/598a.ptn

The given partition achieved the following:
Edge crossings (E) : 2337
cut size: (53117 | 57855)
diff: 4738 (0.0426955 of total n vertices)
Min side: 53117
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.0439972
