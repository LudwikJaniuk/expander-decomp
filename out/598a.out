CASE2 G Expansion target reached with a cut that is relatively balanced. Cut-matching game has found a balanced cut as good as you wanted it.
The best with highest expansion was found on round0
Best cut sparsity: 
Edge crossings (E) : 896
cut size: (97 | 110875)
diff: 110778 (0.998252 of total n vertices)
Min side: 97
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 9.23711
CASE2 Goodenough balanced cut
Writing partition with 110972 nodes to file out/598a.ptn

The given partition achieved the following:
Edge crossings (E) : 2337
cut size: (53117 | 57855)
diff: 4738 (0.0426955 of total n vertices)
Min side: 53117
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.0439972
