The cut with highest capacity required was found on round11
Best cut sparsity: 
Edge crossings (E) : 127
cut size: (4645 | 5155)
diff: 510 (0.0520408 of total n vertices)
Min side: 4645
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.0273412
Writing partition with 9800 nodes to file out/whitaker3.ptn

The given partition achieved the following:
Edge crossings (E) : 126
cut size: (4892 | 4908)
diff: 16 (0.00163265 of total n vertices)
Min side: 4892
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.0257563
