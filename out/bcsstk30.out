The cut with highest capacity required was found on round12
Best cut sparsity: 
Edge crossings (E) : 2773
cut size: (7581 | 21343)
diff: 13762 (0.475799 of total n vertices)
Min side: 7581
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.365783
Writing partition with 28924 nodes to file out/bcsstk30.ptn

The given partition achieved the following:
Edge crossings (E) : 6251
cut size: (14245 | 14679)
diff: 434 (0.0150048 of total n vertices)
Min side: 14245
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.438821
