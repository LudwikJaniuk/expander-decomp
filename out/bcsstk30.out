CASE2 G Expansion target reached with a cut that is relatively balanced. Cut-matching game has found a balanced cut as good as you wanted it.
The best with highest expansion was found on round0
Best cut sparsity: 
Edge crossings (E) : 674
cut size: (20 | 28904)
diff: 28884 (0.998617 of total n vertices)
Min side: 20
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 33.7
CASE2 Goodenough balanced cut
Writing partition with 28924 nodes to file out/bcsstk30.ptn

The given partition achieved the following:
Edge crossings (E) : 6251
cut size: (14245 | 14679)
diff: 434 (0.0150048 of total n vertices)
Min side: 14245
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.438821
