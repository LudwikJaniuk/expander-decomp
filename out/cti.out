The cut with highest capacity required was found on round14
Best cut sparsity: 
Edge crossings (E) : 266
cut size: (7560 | 9280)
diff: 1720 (0.102138 of total n vertices)
Min side: 7560
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.0351852
Writing partition with 16840 nodes to file out/cti.ptn

The given partition achieved the following:
Edge crossings (E) : 318
cut size: (8360 | 8480)
diff: 120 (0.00712589 of total n vertices)
Min side: 8360
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.0380383
