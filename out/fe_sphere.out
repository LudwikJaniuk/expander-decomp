The cut with highest capacity required was found on round13
Best cut sparsity: 
Edge crossings (E) : 482
cut size: (6963 | 9423)
diff: 2460 (0.150128 of total n vertices)
Min side: 6963
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.069223
Writing partition with 16386 nodes to file out/fe_sphere.ptn

The given partition achieved the following:
Edge crossings (E) : 384
cut size: (8097 | 8289)
diff: 192 (0.0117173 of total n vertices)
Min side: 8097
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.047425
