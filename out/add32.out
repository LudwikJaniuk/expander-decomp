The cut with highest capacity required was found on round1
Best cut sparsity: 
Edge crossings (E) : 6
cut size: (1674 | 3286)
diff: 1612 (0.325 of total n vertices)
Min side: 1674
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.00358423
Writing partition with 4960 nodes to file out/add32.ptn

The given partition achieved the following:
Edge crossings (E) : 10
cut size: (2479 | 2481)
diff: 2 (0.000403226 of total n vertices)
Min side: 2479
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.00403388
