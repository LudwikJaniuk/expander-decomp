The cut with highest capacity required was found on round16
Best cut sparsity: 
Edge crossings (E) : 130
cut size: (5005 | 6139)
diff: 1134 (0.101759 of total n vertices)
Min side: 5005
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.025974
Writing partition with 11144 nodes to file out/fe_4elt2.ptn

The given partition achieved the following:
Edge crossings (E) : 130
cut size: (5572 | 5572)
diff: 0 (0 of total n vertices)
Min side: 5572
E/min(|S|, |comp(S)|) = 0.0233309
