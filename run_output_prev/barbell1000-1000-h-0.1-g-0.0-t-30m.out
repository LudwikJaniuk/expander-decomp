H Conductance target reached, this will be case 1 or 3. According to theory, this means we probably won't find a better cut. That is, assuming you set H_phi right. If was used together with G_phi target, this also certifies the input graph is a G_phi expander unless there was a very unbaanced cut somewhere, which we will proceed to look for.
